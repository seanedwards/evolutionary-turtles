RabbitTurtles implements a genetic algorithm to simulate a simple life form 
("rabbit turtles") in a world of limited resources. The name of the project
comes from the name of the assignment, which was to adapt a Logo-esque turtles
library into a simulation of organisms ("rabbits") consuming food (grass) in
the turtle world.

This project ignores most of the actual given assignment, and instead implements
a genetic algorithm for rabbit survival. Turtles wander randomly and consume
food at a constant rate. The selection function is starvation. When turtles have
sufficient excess energy, they reproduce asexually. A turtle's offspring 
receives a mutation of its own genes, and a percentage of its own stored energy.
